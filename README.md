# Traffic-Offense-Management-

This decentralized application on the Ethereum Blockchain focuses on the real-world application of using a blockchain in a city-wide traffic offense record system. 
The DApp allows users to register and search for offenses in their name and pay the required fines (in eth).  The system also allows the admin to add area zones under the jurisdiction and police officers to add offenses for users, among other functionalities. The role based access control is maintained using their account addresses as an identifier. 
Solidity is used for the backend and basic HTML and Javascript is used for frontend. Truffle framework and web3.js is used for the communication between the frontend and the backend. 

This was my first project in the world of blockchain development and will be updated with another repository that performs this use case with the latest solidity compiler version, improvements in the form of storage for the offense records by using IPFS, and improvements on frontend by using ReactJs and NextJs.
